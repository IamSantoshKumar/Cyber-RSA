Description: # Cyber-RSA
        
        A Python package to generate Cipher.
        
        ## Usage
        
        RSA is an asymmetric system , 
        which means that a key pair will be generated , 
        a public key and a private key ,
        obviously you keep your private key secure and pass around the public one.
        
        ```
          Import CyberRSA
        
          encoded = encrypt(message, PublicKey())
          decoded = decrypt(encoded, PrivateKey())
          
          message- Message to encrypt
          
          PublicKey - To read the public key from PEM file.
          
          PrivateKey - To read the Private key from PEM file.
          
          generate_keys() - Using this function we can generate public key and private key PEM file in oneshot (PEM file available in parent directory of the python script).
        
          encoded - Encrypted message send across network.
          
          decoded - Decrypted message.
        
        ```
